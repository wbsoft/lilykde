LilyKDE Installation instructions
=================================

LilyKDE depends one some packages, that need to be installed first:

package:  tested with version:  website:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
KDE (esp. Kate, KPDF) 3.5.x     http://www.kde.org/
sip                   4.7.3     http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/
PyKDE                 3.17.4    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/
PyQt                  3.16      http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
Python                2.4, 2.5  http://www.python.org/
Pate                  0.5.1     http://paul.giannaros.org/pate/
Rumor (optional)      1.0.3b    http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/
LilyPond (of course!) 2.11.x    http://lilypond.org/

Please use the tools of your operating system to install these
prerequisites.  If you need to build Pate from source, install it to the
same prefix as KDE, e.g. ./configure --prefix=$(kde-config --prefix)
and make sure it links to the most recent Python on your system.

Then unpack the LilyKDE tarball (you obviously did :-) and cd into the
extracted package:

	tar zxf lilykde-x.x.tar.gz
	cd lilykde-x.x/

To install in your local ~/.kde directory, just type:

	make install

To install system-wide:

	make
	su
	make PREFIX=$(kde-config --prefix) install

Then launch Kate and enable Pate in Settings->Configure Kate->Plugins.
As Pate starts, LilyKDE will start as well.  You can enable or disable
Pate plugins using Settings->Configure Python Plugins.

You may want to associate Kate with LilyPond files. Right-click a
LilyPond file, select Properties, and click on the small configure icon.
Then, under Applications for this filetype, click Add and select Kate or
enter the command:

	kate -u %U

Close the dialogs by clicking OK.


For distributors:
=================

Use:
	make &&
	make DESTDIR=/some/path PREFIX=$(kde-config --prefix) install

to install LilyKDE to some temporary image directory, from which a
package can be created. DESTDIR should be an absolute path.
