Installation instructions:

cmake .
make
make install

The default prefix is /usr/local, this can be changed with e.g.

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/kde/4.1

Of course, to compile it you need cmake and the KDE4 -devel packages.
For packaging, you can also install to a subdirectory:

make install DESTDIR=/path/to/packagedir
