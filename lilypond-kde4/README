This is a small package with LilyPond-related files that can be shared
between KDE applications that interact with LilyPond, the GNU music
typesetter (http://lilypond.org/).

It contains:

* Indenter script for Kate (lilypond.js)
  (in $KDE/share/apps/katepart/script/)

* Icons for text/x-lilypond mimetype, for oxygen, crystalsvg and hicolor,
  based on the music note XPM from LilyPond.

* A textedit:// protocol handler (ktexteditservice), that opens
  textedit:// links a (running) (LilyPond) editor, configured
  via the KDE associations of the text/x-lilypond MIME type.
