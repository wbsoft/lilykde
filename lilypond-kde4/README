lilypond-kde4
=============

http://lilykde.googlecode.com/

This is a small package with LilyPond-related files that can be shared
between KDE applications that interact with LilyPond, the GNU music
typesetter (http://lilypond.org/).

It contains:

* Indenter script for Kate (lilypond.js)
  (in $KDE/share/apps/katepart/script/)

* Icons for text/x-lilypond mimetype, for oxygen, crystalsvg and hicolor,
  based on the music note XPM from LilyPond.

* A textedit:// protocol handler (ktexteditservice), that opens textedit://
  links in a (running) (LilyPond) editor, configured via the KDE associations
  of the text/x-lilypond MIME type. How editors are started to jump to a
  specific cursor position can be configured in the configuration file
  ktexteditservicerc.

  The protocol handler also looks at the TEXTEDIT_DBUS_PATH environment
  variable. If defined, it should contain a DBus address that can be called
  to let the application open the textedit URL.
  
  If a specialized LilyPond editing app sets the variable to e.g.
  "org.myapplication/textedit", the protocol handler calls the method
  "openTextEditUrl" on it, with the URL as argument and using the interface
  "org.lilypond.TextEdit".

  This way, an application could embed Okular and clicking on notes or lyrics
  directly calls the exposed DBus object.
