TODO for lilypond-kde4

- look if ktexteditservice protocol can become a non-helper protocol
  (that would run quicker)

- run the application via the KDE service mechanism. This way an editor
  that requires a terminal would really be started in a terminal.
  Must look how our own arguments can be added then, though.
