LilyKDE: LilyPond KDE Integration
=================================

This is a set of tools to integrate the very fine LilyPond music
typesetter into KDE 3.x.

It currently consists of:

* a Kate plugin (using Pate, written in Python) that can run LilyPond
  for you, embedding a PDF preview right into Kate and other nice
  things.
* A textedit service so you can click on the notes in the preview (or
  any other PDF viewer) and have Kate jump to the correct position.
* Powerful LilyPond syntax highlighting (already part of KDE).
* An icon and mimetype for *.ly files. The icon was taken from LilyPond.
* Some settings in katefiletyperc, to indent LilyPond files nicely and
  always use utf8 encoding by default. These are installed on first run.
* A Konqueror service menu to convert LilyPond files to PDF.

See INSTALL for information about how to install LilyKDE.
