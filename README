LilyKDE: LilyPond KDE Integration
=================================

This is a set of tools to integrate the very fine LilyPond music
typesetter into KDE 3.x.

It currently consists of:

* a Kate plugin (using Pate, written in Python) that can run LilyPond
  for you, embedding a PDF preview right into Kate and other nice
  things.
* A textedit service so you can click on the notes in the preview (or
  any other PDF viewer) and have Kate jump to the correct position.
* Powerful LilyPond syntax highlighting (already part of KDE).
* An icon and mimetype for *.ly files. The icon was taken from LilyPond.
* Some settings in katefiletyperc, to indent LilyPond files nicely and
  always use utf8 encoding by default. These are installed on first run.
* A Konqueror service menu to convert LilyPond files to PDF.

See INSTALL for information about how to install LilyKDE.

After you installed Pate and LilyKDE, you have to enable Pate in order
to run Python plugins (such as LilyKDE) inside Kate. To do this,
launch Kate and enable Pate in Settings->Configure Kate->Plugins.
From now on LilyKDE will always start as well, and a LilyPond menu
should appear in the Kate menubar.

In the Settings menu you will find a new entry Configure Python Plugins.
There you can enable or disable LilyKDE (called LilyPond in the plugin
list) and the other Python plugins that come with Pate. You can also
adjust some LilyKDE settings there, should that be necessary.
