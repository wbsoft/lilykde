LilyPond KDE Integration
========================

http://lilykde.googlecode.com/


This is a set of tools to integrate the very fine LilyPond music
typesetter into KDE 3.x.

It currently consists of:

* a Kate plugin (using Pate, written in Python) that can run LilyPond
  for you, embedding a PDF preview right into Kate and other nice
  things,

* A textedit service so you can click on the notes in the preview (or
  any other PDF viewer) and have Kate jump to the correct position,

* Powerful LilyPond syntax highlighting (already part of KDE)

* An icon and mimetype for *.ly files. The icon was taken from LilyPond.

* Some settings in katefiletyperc, to indent LilyPond files nicely and
  always use utf8 encoding by default.


Requirements
============

package  tested   website
         with:
-------------------------
KDE      3.5      http://www.kde.org/
PyKDE    3.17.4   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/
PyQt     3.16     http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
Python   2.4      http://www.python.org/
Pate     0.5.1    http://paul.giannaros.org/pate/

Please use the tools of your operating system to install these
prerequisites.  If you need to build Pate from source, install it to the
same prefix as KDE, e.g. ./configure --prefix=$(kde-config --prefix)


Installation
============

make && make install

This currently installs LilyKDE to your home directory. (Systemwide
installation is possible with export KDEHOME=/usr/path/to/kde where
kdelibs and Pate are installed to.  Your mileage may vary.)

Then launch Kate and enable Pate in Settings->Configure Kate->Plugins.
Then select Settings->Configure Python Plugins and enable LilyPond.

You may associate Kate with LilyPond files. Right-click a LilyPond file,
select Properties, and click on the small configure icon. Then, under
Applications for this filetype, click Add and select Kate or enter the
command:

	kate -u %U

Close the dialogs by clicking OK.
