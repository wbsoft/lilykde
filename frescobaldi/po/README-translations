How to translate Frescobaldi to your (favorite) language:
=====================================================
kate: encoding utf8;


First create an empty but initialized po file for your language.
(PO means: Portable Object)

If you want to translate Frescobaldi to your current locale,
simply enter:

$ cd po/
$ msginit -i frescobaldi.pot

otherwise specify the desired language with:

$ msginit -i frescobaldi.pot -l xx_CC

where xx_CC is e.g. en_GB.

Now you can edit the xx.po file with a tool like KBabel.  If done,
you can send the translated po file to the Frescobaldi author if you 
like, to contribute it to the Frescobaldi project.

There are many instrument names in Frescobaldi, with the full name and
abridged name in one string, separated by a pipe symbol (|). This is done
so that you can understand how to translate the short names. You should
translate both the full and abridged names and also include the pipe symbol
in the resulting string, so

"Soprano|S." becomes "Sopraan|S." (dutch)
"Organ|Org." becomes "Orgue|Org." (french)
"Organ|Org." becomes "Órgano|Órg." (spanish)

Note that this use of the pipe symbol in translations differs from the
convention in some projects that the pipe symbol denotes a comment.
