How to translate Frescobaldi to your (favorite) language:
=========================================================

First create an empty but initialized po file for your language.
(PO means: Portable Object)

If you want to translate Frescobaldi to your current locale, simply enter:

$ cd po/
$ msginit -i frescobaldi.pot

otherwise specify the desired language with:

$ msginit -i frescobaldi.pot -l xx_CC

where xx_CC is e.g. en_GB.

Now you can edit the xx.po file with a tool like Lokalize. If done, you can send
the translated po file to the Frescobaldi author if you like, to contribute it
to the Frescobaldi project.

There are many instrument names in Frescobaldi, with the full name and abridged
name in one string, separated by a pipe symbol (|). This is done so that you can
understand how to translate the short names. You should translate both the full
and abridged names and also include the pipe symbol in the resulting string, so:

"Soprano|S." becomes "Sopraan|S." (dutch)
"Organ|Org." becomes "Orgue|Org." (french)
"Organ|Org." becomes "Órgano|Órg." (spanish)

Note that this use of the pipe symbol in translations differs from the 
convention in some projects that the pipe symbol denotes a comment.


Translating the texts in the expansions and frescobaldi.desktop files
=====================================================================

In the data/ directory there are two files that also contain texts that can be
translated. The expansions file contains LilyPond snippets with their
descriptions for the Expansions Manager. Translate the descriptions by adding
a Name[xx] key for your locale, e.g.:

[a4]
Name=Paper Size A4
Name[nl]=Papierformaat A4
Name[de]=Papierformat A4
Text=#(set-paper-size "a4")

The frescobaldi.desktop file contains a description of Frescobaldi for the menu.
You can translate the GenericName key so the translated description appears in
the menu, like:

[Desktop Entry]
GenericName=LilyPond Music Editor
GenericName[nl]=Muziek-editor voor LilyPond
GenericName[it]=Editor musicale per LilyPond

Etcetera. Enjoy and thanks for your contribution!
