The recommended way to install Frescobaldi (from the frescobaldi directory) is:

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

Out-of-source builds are also possible, e.g.:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

Frescobaldi depends on:
- lilypond-kde4 (http://lilykde.googlecode.com/) (not needed in KDE 4.2+)
- KDE 4.1.2 or higher, esp. kdelibs, kdebase and Okular from kdegraphics
- Qt 4.4
- Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6
- PyQt4
- PyKDE4.

You also need to install the corresponding -dev packages from the above to
install Frescobaldi from this source package.

If you install Frescobaldi from the SVN repository, you need LilyPond,
ImageMagick and GNU Gettext. Those are used to build the icons with musical
symbols and the translations. If you install Frescobaldi from a released
tarball, those files have already been prebuilt. (In that case, a "prebuilt"
directory is present. You can safely remove the "prebuilt" directory if you
want to rebuild icons or change translations.)

Some other useful programs are:
- LilyPond (of course!) http://lilypond.org/
- Rumor                 http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/
- a MIDI player like timidity++, etc.
