The recommended way to install Frescobaldi (from the frescobaldi directory) is:


mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install


Frescobaldi depends on KDE4, Python>=2.4 and PyKDE4.
Other useful programs are LilyPond (of course!), Rumor, PDFTK, timidity++, etc.
