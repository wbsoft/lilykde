How to install Frescobaldi:
===========================

To install Frescobaldi in /usr/local:

cmake .
make
make install

To install Frescobaldi in your distributions default KDE4 directory (also 
recommended for creating installable distribution packages):

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

Out-of-source builds are also possible, e.g.:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

If you install Frescobaldi from a released tarball, the LilyPond musical symbol
icons in pics/ and the translations in po/ are already prebuilt.

If you build Frescobaldi out-of-source (or if you install Frescobaldi from SVN),
those icons and translations need to be generated. In that case you also need
LilyPond, ImageMagick and GNU Gettext.


CMake command line options:
===========================

The installation can be customized in a few ways.

If you don't want to install the User Guide (some Linux distros split
applications and their documentation), add -DHANDBOOK=NO to the cmake command
line.

If you don't want to bytecompile the Python modules on install (some Linux
distros want their own installers to do that), add -DBYTECOMPILE=NO to the cmake
command line.

If you get errors about missing Python modules, but you're sure that they are
installed, CMake might be finding the wrong Python version. If you e.g. install
PyKDE4 inside Python 2.5 but CMake is finding Python 2.6 then you get errors
about missing modules. You can fix this by explicitly defining the Python
interpreter to use. Add -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.5 to the cmake
command line in that case.

 
Dependencies:
=============

This is the development (1.1) branch of Frescobaldi. It depends on:
- KDE 4.3.2 or higher, esp. kdelibs, Okular and Konsole
- Qt 4.5 or higher
- Python 2.6
- python-dbus (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings#python)
- SIP 4.9.1 or higher (4.9.3 or higher recommended)
- PyQt4 4.6 or higher
- PyKDE4 4.0.2 or higher

The stable (1.0) branch of Frescobaldi depends on:
- KDE 4.1.2 or higher, esp. kdelibs, Okular and Konsole
- Qt 4.4 or higher
- Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6
- python-dbus (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings#python)
- SIP 4.7.7 til 4.9.3
- PyQt4 4.4.3 or higher
- PyKDE4 4.0.2 or higher

For the stable branch, KDE 4.2 or higher is recommended. If you use KDE 4.1,
you also need lilypond-kde4 (http://lilykde.googlecode.com/)

You also might need to install some of the the corresponding -dev packages from
the above to install Frescobaldi from this source package.


Other useful programs:
======================

Some other useful programs to use together with Frescobaldi are:
- LilyPond (of course!) http://lilypond.org/
- Rumor                 http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/
- a MIDI player like timidity++, etc.
