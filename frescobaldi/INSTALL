How to install Frescobaldi:
===========================

The recommended way to install Frescobaldi (from the frescobaldi directory) is:

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

Out-of-source builds are also possible, e.g.:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

If you install Frescobaldi from a released tarball, the LilyPond musical symbol
icons in pics/ and the translations in po/ are already prebuilt.

If you build Frescobaldi out-of-source (or if you install Frescobaldi from SVN),
those icons and translations need to be generated. In that case you also need
LilyPond, ImageMagick and GNU Gettext.


Dependencies:
=============

Frescobaldi depends on:
- lilypond-kde4 (http://lilykde.googlecode.com/) (not needed in KDE 4.2+)
- KDE 4.1.2 or higher, esp. kdelibs, kdebase and Okular from kdegraphics
- Qt 4.4
- Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6
- PyQt4
- PyKDE4.

You also might need to install some of the the corresponding -dev packages from
the above to install Frescobaldi from this source package.

If you get errors about missing Python modules, but you're sure that they are
installed, CMake might be finding the wrong Python version. If you e.g. install
PyKDE4 inside Python 2.5 but CMake is finding Python 2.6 then you get errors
about missing modules. You can fix this by explicitly defining the Python
interpreter to use, e.g.:

cmake . -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.5


Other useful programs:
======================

Some other useful programs to use together with Frescobaldi are:
- LilyPond (of course!) http://lilypond.org/
- Rumor                 http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/
- a MIDI player like timidity++, etc.
