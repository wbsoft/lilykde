The recommended way to install Frescobaldi (from the frescobaldi directory) is:

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

Out-of-source builds are also possible, e.g.:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --exec-prefix)
make
make install

If you install Frescobaldi from a released tarball, the LilyPond musical symbol
icons in pics/ and the translations in po/ are already prebuilt.

If you build Frescobaldi out-of-source (or if you install Frescobaldi from SVN),
those icons and translations are regenerated. In that case you also need
LilyPond, ImageMagick and GNU Gettext.

Frescobaldi depends on:
- lilypond-kde4 (http://lilykde.googlecode.com/) (not needed in KDE 4.2+)
- KDE 4.1.2 or higher, esp. kdelibs, kdebase and Okular from kdegraphics
- Qt 4.4
- Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6
- PyQt4
- PyKDE4.

You also might need to install some of the the corresponding -dev packages from
the above to install Frescobaldi from this source package.

Some other useful programs are:
- LilyPond (of course!) http://lilypond.org/
- Rumor                 http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/
- a MIDI player like timidity++, etc.
