Changes in 1.1.0 --

* New dialog to insert special characters from the Unicode table, with the
  ability to assign keyboard shortcuts to often used characters.
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to the articulation buttons

Changes in 1.0.0 -- 

* Editor:
  - Right-click menu action on \include command now opens the named file from
    the LilyPond data directory if that exists and there is no local file with
    that name.
* Repeat last expression (Ctrl+;):
  - Does not repeat normal rests and skips (because often one is interested in
    the chord preceding the rest)
  - Keeps the \rest when repeating a pitched rest (e.g. c\rest)
  - Only removes the octave from the repeated pitch (or from the first pitch
    of the repeated chord) inside relative music
* Blank staff paper tool:
  - option to remove small "FRESCOBALDI.ORG" tagline at bottom
* Score Wizard:
  - Fix lyrics not added if there is only one staff (reported by M. Moles)
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - If cursor is inside a chord, note or rest, the cursor is positioned right
    after the chord, note or rest before the articulation is inserted (if there
    is no selection, in which case the articulation is inserted after all
    chords, notes or rests). So now you can click a note in the PDF and directly
    click a button to add an articulation or ornament etc. without repositioning
    the cursor manually.
* General:
  - Fix crash on moving tools around
  - ESC key now closes PDF-preview dialogs properly
  - ESC key does not take focus away from editor window if PDF visible
  - Main window is activated when clicking on notes in detached PDF viewer
  - Fix interaction with SIP 4.9.3 (some settings were not saved, like paths)
  - Fix order of cautionary accidentals and octave marks in pitches (affects
    transpose and relative/absolute conversion functions)
  - Fix attribute error on file dialogs in KDE 4.1 (but KDE 4.2 is recommended)
  - Improved hyphenation dictionaries search, also some explanation in docs
* Installation:
  - CMake now does not require a compiler to be present anymore
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
  - Turkish updated by S. Acim
  - Italian updated by Gianluca D'Orazio
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
  - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
  - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
  - German updated by Georg Hennig

Changes in 0.7.17 -- November 29th, 2009

* Expansion Dialog:
  - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to snippets in the dialog
  - Improved syntax coloring in snippet entry
* Autocompletion:
  - If the autocompleter does not find any suitable completions, matching
    expansions from the Expansion dialog are shown
* Score Wizard:
  - Harp, Guitar and Jazz Guitar: allow multiple voices per staff
  - Choir: checkbox for automatic piano reduction
* General bugfixes and improvements:
  - When quitting, the last seen documents, starting with the current, are
    closed first. This way, if the user cancels the quit, the current document
    (if modified) remains the same.
  - Files can be opened by dropping them on the Frescobaldi window
  - Fix crash when swichting to a document opened using the Open File dialog
    when multiple files were opened at the same time
  - All pitch manipulation functions better detect the end of unbracketed markup
    expressions like: g g g-\markup \sharp g g g.  Frescobaldo now knows the
    number of arguments each markup command has and will not mistake the g after
    \sharp for a markup argument.
* Installation:
  - building and installing the User Guide has been improved. If meinproc4 or
    the XSL stylesheets can't be found, only a warning is printed and the cache
    file (index.cache.bz2) is not pre-generated, but the install will continue.
    (If there is no cache file, KHelpcenter will generate one on a per-user
    basis as soon as the User Guide is displayed for the first time.)
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by me
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
  - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
  - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh

Changes in 0.7.16 -- November 15th, 2009

* New commands for conversion between relative and absolute pitches
* New: Alt+Shift+Up/Down selects text till next or previous blank line, and
  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up/Down moves the selected block to the next or previous blank
  line. This gives a very quick way to reorder fragments of LilyPond input.
* A new tool to create empty staff paper
* Improved support for quarter tones in all pitch-related functions
* Translations:
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila

Changes in 0.7.15 -- October 13th, 2009

* New LilyPond documentation browser providing context-sensitive help
* New shortcuts:
  - Repeat selected music, Ctrl+Shift+R: wraps the selection in a
    \repeat volta 2 { music... } construct
  - Insert pair of braces, Ctrl+{: wraps the selection in braces, or inserts
    { newline newline } and places the cursor on the middle indented line.
* New bar lines submenu to insert different types of bar lines
* Expansion Manager:
  - Two cursormarks (|) can be used to select a range of text after expanding
  - New contextmenu command to add selected text to expansions

  - named colors are shown in the right color
  - some often used block commands like \header now also insert the braces,
    and place the cursor between them.
  - names of variables (like composer in the header) automagically append ' = ' 
    if the remainder of the line does not start with the '=' character.
* New commands in the Log context menu to copy or save its contents.
* LilyPond symbol icons are displayed white if the users color palette settings
  have light text on a dark background. The icons are automatically recolored
  if the user changes the color preferences while Frescobaldi is running.
* The Save As... dialog now really opens in the default directory if the
  document has no filename yet.
* Tools can be shown/hidden with configurable keyboard shortcuts
* Score Wizard: parts can be reordered by dragging with the mouse
* Documentation updates

* Translations:
  - Turkish updated by S. Acim
  - Russian updated by S. Poltavski

Changes in 0.7.12 -- July 1st, 2009

* It is now possible to run LilyPond on remote documents and documents that have
  not been saved yet. In such cases Frescobaldi internally saves the LilyPond
  file to a local temporary directory. Point and click also works on remote or
  unnamed documents. This makes it easy to paste something from an email and run
  LilyPond immediately, without bothering to save it first under a suitable file
  name. The local cache is deleted when the document is closed or saved to a
  directory on the local file system.
* It is now possible to configure external applications for PDF and MIDI files.
  These will then be used instead of the KDE default configured applications.
* New align action (LilyPond->Source Document->Indent) that properly indents a
  document or selection of lines. This indenter is a bit more robust than the
  one built into KatePart. The Score Wizard and Expand Manager now also use the
  users indentation settings, instead of always using two spaces indent.
* New shortcuts to insert nice typographical quotes: Ctrl+' for single and
  Ctrl+" for double quotes. Left and right quotes are automatically determined.
  If text is selected, the selected text is put between quotes.
* Repeat last note/chord: only keep articulations and ties.
* Bug fixes:
  - Smart Point and Click remains working if pitches are translated
  - Text editor keeps keyboard focus again when clicked in PDF preview
  - Rumor plugin more stable in keyboard mode and stops cleanly if running on
    Frescobaldi exit
* Translations:
  - French updated by David Bouriaud (thanks!)
  - Dutch updated by self

Changes in 0.7.11 -- June 15th, 2009

* Stability improvements

Changes in 0.7.10 -- June 9th, 2009

* Point and click: Shift-click in the PDF preview now selects music from current
  cursor position to new cursor position. So you can select a music fragment by
  clicking on the first note and then shift-clicking on the last note.
* Editor:
  - Context sensitive context (right-click) menu with, besides the usual cut,
    copy and paste, commands to open \include file, hyphenate lyrics and
    Cut & Assign text (if selected)
  - The Cut & Assign command (Ctrl+Shift+C) now obeys inputmodes. If you e.g.
    cut out some lyrics, the fragment will automatically be wrapped in a
    \lyricmode { } block.
  - Autocompletion for accidental styles
* User Interface:
  - new document tab bar for easy navigation between open files, can be hidden
  - when running LilyPond and the option 'Save document when LilyPond is run' is
    enabled, the Save As dialog is displayed when the document has no filename
    yet.
* Translations:
  - German translation updated by Georg Hennig (thanks!)

Changes in 0.7.9 -- May 23rd, 2009

* Bugfixes:
  - spurious crashes seem to have been gone (by using thread locks on
    katepart's SmartInterface)

  - Alt-Up and Alt-Down now jump to the first line of a blank block instead of
    just the next or previous blank line.

  - remove octave mark from first pitch
  - remove barcheck pipe symbols
* Score Wizard:

  changed without re-running LilyPond. Also the clickable messages in the log.
  Smart Point & Click from the PDF preview only works in KDE 4.2.
* New option to only show the log if LilyPond outputs warnings or errors
* Progress bar in statusbar shows LilyPond progress
* Bugfixes:
  * Make Frescobaldi exit gracefully if a LilyPond job was still running
  * Make Point & Click work again in KDE 4.2 if there are tabs in the document.
  * Fixed Change Pitch Language, sometimes this function didn't work if there
    were complicated markups in the document.

* Score Wizard: if there is more than one part, make separate assignments for
  the parts. This simplifies the generated \score { } section and makes it

  * Find translations when installed to non-standard directory
  * Avoid double entries in score wizard instrument name language combobox
