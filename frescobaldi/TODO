TODO for Frescobaldi (ideas)
============================

Music length related (needs infrastructure to compute duration of music
expressions):

- bar check feedback: display a status message or balloonhint showing the length
  of the entered music between the entered barcheck (pipe symbol) and the
  previous one. Just to have a quick check that the bar length is OK.

- auto-insert bar checks 

- auto-insert comments with the bar number (every 5 measures or so)


Filtering music expressions:

- split out e.g. articulations or dynamics and put them in a separate expression
  attached to skips, so they can be overlaid to other voices dynamically.

- (re)combine music expressions


General:

- Session save and restore (possibly combined with named sessions like Kate)


Editing:

- Document properties dialog that parses the current paper, layout, score and
  (possibly) header sections and makes all kinds of quick adjustments possible,
  such as paper size, raggedness, margins, bar and pagenumbering, headers,
  distances, staff size, default fonts, etc.

- Full normalize the source document layout (indent properly, line breaks at
  sensible places, add { } to ambiguous markup constructs, etc.

- Convert plain input text to markup commands:
  - easy entry of lyric text strophes
  - (justified) paragraphs, lists or tables
  - some wiki-like syntax possible

- Rich-text editor to enter/edit markup:
  - font selection
  - bold, ital, underline
  - alignment
  - urls
  - musical symbols from LilyPond font

- Document structure browser


Output:

- quick PNG of current document (e.g. copied to clipboard or some snippet board)


Documentation browser:

- full text search in all manuals


MIDI:

- replace Rumor plugin with native MIDI in- and output support

- embed MIDI player for playback of files (with stop/start, memory for positions)


User interface:

- list view for opened documents (like Kate)


DONE:
=====

Editing:

- Cut and assign: check mode of cut-out fragment and reuse (e.g. \lyricmode)

- Context sensitive context menu to do all sorts of things on the current
  cursor position or text selection


Pitch related:

- transpose music

- relative -> absolute and vice versa
