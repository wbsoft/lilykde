TODO for Frescobaldi

Music length related (needs infrastructure to compute duration of music
expressions):

- bar check feedback: display a status message or balloonhint showing the length
  of the entered music between the entered barcheck (pipe symbol) and the
  previous one. Just to have a quick check that the bar length is OK.

- auto-insert bar checks 

- auto-insert comments with the bar number (every 5 measures or so)


Pitch related:

- transpose music

- relative -> absolute and vice versa


General:

- Session save and restore (possibly combined with named sessions like Kate)


MIDI:

- replace Rumor plugin with native MIDI in- and output support
- embed MIDI player for playback of files (with stop/start, memory for positions)


Editing:

- Cut and assign: check mode of cut-out fragment and reuse (e.g. \lyricmode)
- Context sensitive context menu to do all sorts of things on the current
  cursor position or text selection


User interface:

- list view for opened documents (like Kate)
