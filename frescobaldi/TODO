TODO for Frescobaldi (also some random ideas)
=============================================


Music length related (needs infrastructure to compute duration of music
expressions):

- bar check feedback: display a status message or balloonhint showing the length
  of the entered music between the entered barcheck (pipe symbol) and the
  previous one. Just to have a quick check that the bar length is OK.

- auto-insert bar checks 

- auto-insert comments with the bar number (every 5 measures or so)


Pitch related:

- command to re-interpret pitches (change alterations, e.g. based on key
  signature), useable to fix wrong accidentals after import of a MIDI file


Filtering music expressions:

- split out e.g. articulations or dynamics and put them in a separate expression
  attached to skips, so they can be overlaid to other voices dynamically.

- (re)combine music expressions

- Add/remove slurs etc. to selected music fragment


Score Wizard:

- support nested groups in part list (e.g. StaffGroup or GrandStaff)
- separate \score { } for the MIDI output
- idea: support multiple movements (i.e. number of scores) (idea of M. Moles)
- idea: some font settings, e.g. default fonts, title font, etc.
- idea: load/save score setups


General:

- Session save and restore (possibly combined with named sessions like Kate)
- Support other programs besides LilyPond like mup, abc, pmw, cmn, etc.


Editing:

- Document properties dialog that parses the current paper, layout, score and
  (possibly) header sections and makes all kinds of quick adjustments possible,
  such as paper size, raggedness, margins, bar and pagenumbering, headers,
  distances, staff size, default fonts, etc.

- Command to fully normalize the source document layout (indent properly, line
  breaks at sensible places, add { } to ambiguous markup constructs, etc.

- Mixed indent (indent with tabs and/or spaces without converting them to each
  other)

- Convert plain input text to markup commands:
  - easy entry of lyric text strophes
  - (justified) paragraphs, lists or tables
  - some wiki-like syntax possible

- Rich-text editor to enter/edit markup:
  - font selection
  - bold, ital, underline
  - alignment
  - urls
  - musical symbols from LilyPond font

- Document structure browser


Running LilyPond:

- separate "server" process that runs LilyPond and communicates with clients
  like Frescobaldi.  This way a user can exit Frescobaldi while a job is
  running, and have job feedback from the systray and can e.g. start LilyPond
  jobs from a file manager service menu.  The server process exits when there is
  nothing to do, and is automatically started when there is something to do.
  Communication should be done via D-Bus.

PDF Preview:

- tighter coupling with editor part, possibly by using a custom PDF (or even
  SVG) widget instead of embedding Okular:
  - highlight object text cursor is at
  - right-click object and show relevant options in context menu (by looking
    at the linked position in the document the type of object can be determined)
  - generate \override #'extra-offset command (or other offset types) by
    simply dragging an object
  - select rectangular section in PDF also selects relevant portion in input
    document
    

Output:

- quick PNG of current document (e.g. copied to clipboard or some snippet board)


Documentation browser:

- full text search in all manuals


MIDI:

- replace Rumor plugin with native MIDI in- and output support

- embed MIDI player for playback of files (with stop/start, memory for positions)


User interface:

- list view for opened documents (like Kate)


Import/Export:

- import wizard for MIDI files and other files



DONE:
=====

Editing:
- Cut and assign: check mode of cut-out fragment and reuse (e.g. \lyricmode)
- Context sensitive context menu to do all sorts of things on the current
  cursor position or text selection

Pitch related:
- transpose music
- relative -> absolute and vice versa

Score Wizard:
- more than one voice for Tablature instruments (Guitar, Jazz Guitar)

New LilyPond features (as soon as 2.14 is out):
- snappizicato articulation
- halfopen articulation
