These are Gentoo ebuilds for Pate and LilyKDE.


* kde-misc/pate-0.5.1  (pate-0.5.1.ebuild)

Until Gentoo has an official ebuild for Pate, I suggest placing
pate-0.5.1.ebuild in your Portage overlay, category kde-misc.


* media-sound/lilykde  (lilykde.ebuild)

Save this ebuild as e.g. lilykde-0.4.11.ebuild, depending on the
LilyKDE version you want to install.


* media-sound/lilykde-svn  (lilykde-svn-1.0.ebuild)

This ebuild automatically installs the latest version of LilyKDE
from SVN.  Use this one if you want to live on the bleeding edge :)


Don't forget creating the digests with ebuild <ebuild> digest.
After this, you can simply emerge lilykde.
